# MagicLab
like neofetch but worse

## how to get it working
To get it to work, first

copy the .sh file into a $PATH folder then

run `chmod +x Magiclab.sh` 

You will need to call `MagicLab.sh` to run it

## how it will look

## where have i tested it so far
I've checked on Manjaro(which I think it makes it work on Arch distros), Mint(which I think makes it work on Ubuntu and Debian), and Fedora

## plans for da future
i am not going to lie, i don't really know how to make config files and such, but it really isn't that hard to edit the source code, as it's only about 37 lines long and commented
