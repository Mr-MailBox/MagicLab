# MagicLab
like neofetch but worse

## how to get it working
To get it to work, first

copy the .sh file into a $PATH folder then

run `chmod +x Magiclab.sh` 

You will need to call or `MagicLab.sh` to run it

## where have i tested it so far
I've checked on Manjaro(which I think it makes it work on Arch distros), Mint(which I think makes it work on Ubuntu and Debian), and Fedora
